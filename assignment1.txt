Step 1: Install Java JDK
Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the official Oracle website. After installing, 
  set the environment variable (add the JDK’s bin folder path to the system’s PATH variable) so that
  you can use Java commands like javac and java in CMD. You can check if it’s working by typing java -version and javac -version in Command Prompt.
 Step 2: Write and Save the Java Program
Open Notepad or any text editor and write a simple Java program like this:
code:
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
Save the file as HelloWorld.java (make sure the file name matches the class name exactly). Save it in a folder like C:\JavaPrograms.
 Step 3: Compile and Run the Program in CMD
Open Command Prompt and navigate to the folder where your file is saved using the cd command (e.g., cd C:\JavaPrograms).
  Then type javac HelloWorld.java to compile the program. If there are no errors, it will create a HelloWorld.class file.
  Next, type java HelloWorld to run the program. You should see the output:
output:
Hello, World!
